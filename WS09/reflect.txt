In this workshop, we work with multithreading. In my opinion, it was a small and simple use case but it was enough to understand how it works. 
In essence, the functionality is to encrypt and decrypt files. It is done character by character using a key. For that, we need the file in binary to can make calculations with the content.
On the other hand, std::bind helps to simplify the function converter because we only need to modify half of the parameters, the rest remain constant. It is like making a partial action of the "converter" function.
Finally, working with thread gives us the advantage to make operations quicker because several actions are being done simultaneously. In this workshop, we split the action to encrypt/decrypt in four threads, as a consequence the task will be done faster than it was done in only one thread. The inconvenience of that is that we will need more computational resources.
