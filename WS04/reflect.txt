The main difference between aggregation and composition is that aggregation implies a relationship in which the child can exist independently of the parent. On the other hand, the composition hints at a relationship where the child cannot exist independently of the parent.
Related to copy and move functions implemented in compositions and aggregations I do not appreciate differences. Both have implemented the functions with the same logic. 

In the class ConfirmationSender we appreciate aggregation function. For that reason we code the functions "ConfirmationSender& operator+=(const Reservation& res);
ConfirmationSender& operator-=(const Reservation& res);"
On the other hand, we find the association feature in the "Reservation" class.
Finally, the "composition" type is identified with the "Restaurant" class.
